## Inspiration

TerraGuardians was born from a deep-seated desire to combat the ever-growing environmental crisis, with a primary focus on land and water pollution. Our inspiration stems from the urgent need to protect our planet and foster a global community committed to environmental sustainability. As stewards of Earth, we felt compelled to create a platform that empowers individuals to take action and make a difference in their communities.

## What it does

TerraGuardians is a powerful decentralized application (DApp) designed to address environmental challenges through a multifaceted approach. It incentivizes users to actively participate in cleaning their surroundings by rewarding them with tokens. These tokens can be exchanged for vouchers at multinational corporations and special merchandise, encouraging users to be environmentally responsible while enjoying tangible benefits.

One of the standout features of TerraGuardians is our advanced drone technology, integrated with a custom deep learning model for garbage detection. Drones soar over pollution-prone areas, automatically identifying and reporting trash accumulation. The collected data is presented on our platform, creating a real-time and interactive map of pollution hotspots, making environmental issues transparent and accessible to all.

In addition to user-driven environmental actions, TerraGuardians also invites corporations and organizations to list their cleanup initiatives on our platform. This provides a unique opportunity for these entities to showcase their dedication to sustainability. Users, in turn, can actively support these initiatives through donations or by joining them, fostering a sense of community and collective responsibility.

But TerraGuardians is not just about taking action; it's also about education. Our DApp features an educational hub filled with informative and engaging content regarding pollution, its impact on the environment, and solutions to mitigate its effects. We believe that informed individuals are better equipped to effect positive change in their surroundings and beyond.

## How we built it

TerraGuardians was developed through a meticulous and well-planned process. Our platform combines blockchain technology, drone technology, deep learning models, and user-centric features to achieve our mission. 

1. **Blockchain Technology**: We leverage blockchain technology for our token system, ensuring transparency, security, and trust for our users. Smart contracts manage rewards, donations, and cleanup initiative listings. Ethereum was chosen for its robust capabilities and large developer community.

2. **Drone Technology**: Our drone fleet is equipped with high-resolution cameras and GPS technology. Each drone is integrated with custom deep learning models, trained to detect garbage from aerial images. Data collected from these drones is sent in real-time to our platform.

3. **Deep Learning Models**: The heart of our drone technology is the deep learning model. We trained these models with diverse datasets to ensure accurate garbage detection. The models can distinguish between various types of waste, enabling detailed reporting.

4. **User-Centric Features**: The user experience is at the core of TerraGuardians. We designed an intuitive interface for reporting, donating, and participating in cleanup initiatives. Our DApp offers a seamless connection between users, initiatives, and corporate entities.

## Challenges we ran into

The journey of building TerraGuardians was filled with unique challenges that demanded innovative solutions. Some of the challenges we encountered include:

- **Drone Integration**: Integrating drone technology with blockchain was a complex task. Ensuring the real-time transmission of data to the blockchain without latency was a significant challenge.

- **Deep Learning Model Training**: Training the deep learning models for garbage detection required extensive computational resources. Optimizing the models for speed and accuracy was a time-consuming process.

- **User Engagement**: Encouraging users to actively participate in cleaning initiatives and contribute data was challenging. We had to design intuitive features and implement a reward system that appealed to a wide audience.

- **Blockchain Scalability**: As TerraGuardians gained popularity, we had to address scalability issues on the blockchain to maintain smooth operations even during peak usage.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Through dedication and innovation, we've achieved several accomplishments of which we're immensely proud:
